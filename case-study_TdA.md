# Think different when you work with developers

<sub>Haha, TdA will follow you everywhere.<sub>

**Each year**, our [student association](http://scg.cz/) organize a competition called Tour de App for young developers from Czech and Slovak Republic giving them real-world experience.
These high schoolers work on an assignment with a fictional client. They have to arrange a meeting and ask the client how should the web app look like.
In my part, they are working with brand manual from the client. Unfortunitely there was something I forgot about while making the manual the first time.

Third year of Tour de App, final of the competition takes place in Brno, highschoolers
This year, the project was a web app for a fictional client. The students then work together to complete the assignment. They set up a meeting and ask the client how they envision the web app should look.
My role in this project was to work with the client’s brand manual. But there was one issue. I had overlooked a seemingly minor detail when creating the brand’s visual style manual the first time, and it became a lesson I won’t forget:
The devil is in the details, and even the smallest oversight can make a big impact on any project.
