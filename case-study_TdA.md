# Think different, App developers are coming


I've come to rumors that graphic designers and developers have this huge conflict. Well... I never saw it that way. Until...

## The story

### It's not only about the code. Tour de App
**Each year**, our [student association](http://scg.cz/) Student Cyber Games organizes a competition called [Tour de App](https://tourde.app/) for young developers giving them real-world experience. These high schoolers work on an assignment with a fictional client. They have to arrange a meeting and ask the client how should the web app look like. And here comes my part. They are working with brand manual from the client. Unfortunitely there was something I forgot about while making the manual the first time. I promise. I was not against developers. These things just happen.

### 10 out of 10 developers do not recommend Lalezar font on web app
**Last year** I was the head of PR & Marketing. I was designing a brand for the fictional company, so called Teacher digital Agency. So I designed the logo, choose colours and fonts and forgot about something. They will have to use all of it on a web page. Oh there was trouble to come. Students had some issues with the font because it was not due to technical reasons working out for them. The logo didn't fit on the site well and the colors were too loud. So I took notes. For the next designing was gonna be perfect.

### Competition bro's
**This year** For the new fictional client – whom we now named Think different Academy⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ – I asked my collegues to help me. Now not having too much on my shoulders. So what they did was taking another competition we have and telling me to use the font and the colors we already have trouble using ourselves! But I knew it could work out if our contestants had the right guide. Like warning them about the red and blue not looking good right next to each other. Or maybe be carefull to use the logo the right way. I've written down some points into the new brand manual. How it worked out? Some used the guide very well but for most it was too much for them. Two colors would have been enough. For the logo I made a vertical and a horizontal version so there was not trouble there. They very much liked icons that I created from the logo. The typeface was ok but it was missing some font that can like stand out.

Here are some results from the young developers. I was thrilled when I could just sit there and watching such talents present the whole project they are so proud of filled with my design.
