# Think different when you work with App developers

<sub>Haha, TdA will follow you everywhere.<sub>
## The story

### 
**Each year**, our [student association](http://scg.cz/) organize a competition called Tour de App for young developers from Czech and Slovak Republic giving them real-world experience.
These high schoolers work on an assignment with a fictional client. They have to arrange a meeting and ask the client how should the web app look like.
In my part, they are working with brand manual from the client. Unfortunitely there was something I forgot about while making the manual the first time.

### Better safe then sorry
**Last year** I was designing a brand for fictional company, so called Teacher digital Agency, with no experience with websites. I recommend you to take time with the research. I felt so guilty hearing from our contestants about troubles with the font and the logo and even the coloring. Every day we learn something new and this really taught me a lot and was an excelent experience.

### Jumping in the water again and again
**This year** I was prepared not to make the same mistake again. For the new fictional client – whom we now named Think different Academy⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ – I asked my collegues to help me. So what they did was taking another competition we have and ordering me to use the font and the colors we already have trouble using ourselves! But I knew it could work out if I gave our contestants the right guide like warning them about the red and blue not looking good right next to each other.

AFTER
Third year of Tour de App, final of the competition takes place in Brno, highschoolers
This year, the project was a web app for a fictional client. The students then work together to complete the assignment. They set up a meeting and ask the client how they envision the web app should look.

## My role
in this project was to work with the client’s brand manual. But there was one issue. I had overlooked a seemingly minor detail when creating the brand’s visual style manual the first time, and it became a lesson I won’t forget:
The devil is in the details, and even the smallest oversight can make a big impact on any project.

### Graphic designers Versus Developers
Knowing designers and developers sometimes come to conflict about what is doable or what look better, I want to share this story. Let's be good to our developer. The work they do is really stressing and tiring. I forgot that developers will be working with it
When you have a developer, they work with elements slightly differently then graphic designers. So Lalezar as a font was definitely
#### not a good idea
