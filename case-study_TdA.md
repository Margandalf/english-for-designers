# Think different, App developers are coming

<sub>Haha, TdA will follow you everywhere.<sub>

I've heard some rumors that graphic designers and developers have this huge conflict.

## The story

### Heading to come
**Each year**, our [student association](http://scg.cz/) organize a competition called [Tour de App](https://tourde.app/) for young developers.
These high schoolers work on an assignment with a fictional client. They have to arrange a meeting and ask the client how should the web app look like.
In my part, they are working with brand manual from the client. Unfortunitely there was something I forgot about while making the manual the first time. So let's dive into it.

### Better safe than sorry
**Last year** I was designing a brand for the fictional company, so called Teacher digital Agency, with no experience with websites. Oh there was trouble to come. The font and the logo and even the coloring. Students didn't very much like working with it. So I took notes. For the next was gonna be perfect.

### Jumping in the water again and again
**This year** I am not going to make the same mistake again. For the new fictional client – whom we now named Think different Academy⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ – I asked my collegues to help me. So what they did was taking another competition we have and telling me to use the font and the colors we already have trouble using ourselves! But I knew it could work out if our contestants had the right guide. Like warning them about the red and blue not looking good right next to each other. Or maybe be carefull to use the logo the right way. I've written down some points into the new brand manual.

## What am I taking from this experience
- Think about who you are making the project for. 
- They liked the logo

Here are some results from the young developers.

### Graphic designers Versus Developers
Knowing designers and developers sometimes come to conflict about what is doable or what look better, I want to share this story. Let's be good to our developer. The work they do is stressing and tiring. I forgot that developers will be working with it
When you have a developer, they work with different elements then graphic designers. So Lalezar as a font was definitely
#### not a good idea

1. Lesson: Work with developer friendly fonts
TdA - giving them real-world experience.


### AJ lesson notes
- všechno ve 3 bodech
- různé obrázky (grafika, fotka, screenshot)
- Context for audience
- Zkusit si to odprezentovat sobě a co řeknu navíc si musím zapsat a přidat ten příběh do case study
- Tomáš: Líbí se mi, že odstoupil trochu od designu a popisoval i jídlo a prostředí. Působilo to spíš jako popisování než jako vyprávění. Chyběl mi tam nějaký příběh. Explaining
