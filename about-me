#Ahoj!

TBD

Welcome to my design world!

My name is Margaret (Margareta read in vlamish, my birth language). I grew up in Czechia with my moldavian mother and belgian father. You can imagine how confused I was growing up. 

- I like designing overall and prefer to be helpful for example by designing for educational purposes. I like smart design and find visual identities very fascinating, even energetic.
- I admire the way you can create your projects from dust. Upgrating them and taking care of them is what I like to do.
- by designing I love to discover about new things

Hobbies:
- I show my love by being creative. By drawing, painting or even learning japanese caligraphy.
- As [Terry Pratchett](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/book-series/discworld/), my favorite writer describes in Discworld book series, there is a a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant star turtle.

Hi, I'm Margaret.
Margareta after my grandmother from Moldova and Margareta after my great grandma in Belgium.

My favorite animal is turtle, because I believe in their slowing down to look around and as we know from the tales, they always get somewhere faster then anyone else.

When I was little I always loved to take flowers to my mother and when I learn to write I brought letters to my mother. So I was actually training to draw better, then loved to be more and more creative.
