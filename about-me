# Welcome to my world!

My name is Margareta after my grandma from Moldova and my great grandma from Belgium. I grow up in Czechia with my moldavian mother and belgian father. You can imagine what it's like. 

- designuje v≈°echno, designuje lidi
- educational design
- creating, upgrating and taking care of visual identities
- by designing I love to discover about new things

Hobbies:
- I show my love by being creative. By drawing, painting or even learning japanese caligraphy.
- I deeply admire Turtles and Tortoises and as Terry Pratchett, my favorite writer describes in Discworld book series, there is a a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle.
