# Welcome to my design world!

My name is Margaret (Margareta read in vlamish, my birth language). I grew up in Czechia with my moldavian mother and belgian father. You can imagine how confused I was growing up. 

- I like designing overall and prefer to be helpful for example by designing for educational purposes. I like smart design and find visual identities very fascinating, even energetic.
- I admire the way you can create your projects from dust. Upgrating them and taking care of them is what I like to do.
- by designing I love to discover about new things

Hobbies:
- I show my love by being creative. By drawing, painting or even learning japanese caligraphy.
- As Terry Pratchett, my favorite writer describes in Discworld book series, there is a a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant cosmic turtle.
