# Design Manifesto

<span style="color:#ef8a17">*My Manifesto · last edit 22. 10. 2024*</span>

I dearly love to observe and to create.

No eyes no hands? I fear there would be no reason for me to cherrish such life.

Work in a corporate? Why should I do anything if it brings no good? Work for brands that DESERVE it!

I like to share success with my <span style="color:#ef8a17">_friends_</span> and to be a part of a community. As mentioned in my favorite poem 
> ["When all these creatures move what a wonderful noise there'll be!"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44604/the-quangle-wangles-hat)

It was so hard not to be shamed for the process I have been through. But the clients will never appreaciate the effort if I keep it to myself. I enjoy the trends and value the standards.

TBD -

#### Be lazy
- Find the easiest way to do the job well and <span style="color:#a6ce39">_save time_</span>.
- Work smart, not hard.

- I belive that working hard is not what they call working smart.

#### Don't give up
- My [friend](https://github.com/sprtokiller) once told me 
> <span style="color:#a6ce39">_"Všechno jde, když se chce"_</span> meaning Everything goes well if you put your mind to it!

#### Self-esteem
- Trust your opinion
- Live healthy

#### Break the rules
- Sometimes it's just better to leave all the rules behind and just let the <span style="color:#a6ce39">_flow_</span> take you with it
