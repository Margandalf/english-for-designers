# Design Manifesto

### My manifesto

#### Prosperous
- NO design is worth doing if it brings no good
- NO to waste
- NO to big fancy corporate
#### Teamwork
- NO job can be done as well as when we work on it with friends
- comunity is a big help

#### Priorities
- Work for brands that deserve it
#### Be lazy
- Find the easiest way to do the job well and save your time.
- Work smart, not hard.
#### Don't give up
- My [friend](https://github.com/sprtokiller) told me ``"Všechno jde, když se chce"`` meaning Everything goes well if you put your mind to it!
#### Self-esteem
- Trust your opinion
- Live healthy
#### Break the rules
- Sometimes it's just better to leave all the rules behind not to be bound by them
