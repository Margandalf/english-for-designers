# Introductions


Turtle is a way to slow down.

## Hi
Welcome to my design world!
- Hi, I'm Margaret.
- Hi, my name is Margaret (Margareta read in vlamish, my birth language).

## Call to Action
Hi,
- Let's have some fun!
- Let's work on education and help those in need!
- Let's fight for our nature! 

## Hobbies
- I show my love by being creative. By drawing, painting, crafting and often trying something new like learning japanese caligraphy.
- As [Terry Pratchett](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/book-series/discworld/), my favorite writer describes in Discworld book series, there is a a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant star turtle.
- I write about everything that touches me in my diary and use it as my problem solver. Finding my way through the pages.
- I use my imagination a lot. I feel like I could imagine anything even the impossible.
- I love science fiction.

## Story time!
- Margareta after my grandmother from Moldova and Margareta after my great grandma in Belgium.
- My favorite animal is turtle, because I believe in their slowing down to look around and as we know from the tales, they always get somewhere faster then anyone else.
- When I was little I always loved to take flowers to my mother and when I learn to write I brought letters to my mother. So I was actually training to draw better, then loved to be more and more creative.
- I grew up in Czechia with my moldavian mother and belgian father. You can imagine how confused I was growing up. 

## Me and designing
- I like designing overall and prefer to be helpful for example by designing for educational purposes. I like smart design and find visual identities very fascinating, even energetic.
- I admire the way you can create your projects from dust. Upgrating them and taking care of them is what I like to do.
- by designing I love to discover about new things
