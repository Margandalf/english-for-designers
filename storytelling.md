Hello, Margaret here

As a child I never thought I could do something like a graphic design. I was planning to be a painter as my grandmothers sister was or a princess.

## Teambuilding XO19
Five years ago, everything changed without me even noticing. I was cut out from my surpression and got every chance to make myself comfortable around people. In 2019 my friend brought me to this teambuilding I knew nothing about. There were lots of young people around my age. This was a real team making a real project. Youg students being able to make a competition for all students in Czech and Slovak. The best I have known. From this weekend I was going home as an event organiser with 5 tournaments to go to. So I just prepared a lot, beacause I was scared if I could make it. I did it. I went and did a presentation in a room of 70 people and it was awesome. Only this trust I was given has made me so much more confident.

## At school I'm good at this, can I try?
While studying Exhibition architecture I had so much fun learning how to use all these graphic programmes. But there just wasn't a place for me to try at school. If you're struggling to find the right chance, just ask for it. I did so in Student Cyber Games and that's how my graphic design journey really begun. I started little but now have made so many competition graphic campaings just because I asked once.


## Returning the favor
I felt that I still didn't give to the community Student Cyber Games my all. I cannot leave you guys with this image since I know you're so much better then what you are showing.

## Where is this leading me?
So as a graphic designer I don't want just to be creative but as others shown in their presentations, life is full of things that move us. For me it is nature and sociaty that wants move forward.
My parents taught me to be kind and to love nature with their own ambitions.
Student Cyber Games has taught me a lot about teamwork and project and so much more from working online to giving a speech.

## I like doing this
Since I found that graphic design really fullfilles me, I had to look for a place to learn more. And that's how I got here. I have met so many talented people at this school and I hope you guys will be still so awesome.

## They all taught me
Soon enough I discovered my life cannot be only about creating even if I wanted it to be. Anxieties has taugh me to be kind and to handle people gently. My parents taught me to love nature with their own ambitions. Student Cyber Games has taught me a lot about teamwork and project and so much more from working online to giving a speech.
