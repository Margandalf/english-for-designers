Hello, Margaret here

This is not how people were always calling me. Margareta. Thats was the name. In czech republic.

I was raised here in the Czech Republic by a Belgian father and a Moldavian mother.

## Always the shy girl
Making friends at school was always a struggle for me. I was too shy and got my anxieties from trying to get along. 

## Teambuilding XO19
Five years ago, everything changed without me even noticing. I was cut out from my surpression and got every chance to make myself comfortable around people. In 2019 my friend brought me to this teambuilding I knew nothing about. There were lots of young people around my age. This was a real team making a real project. Youg students being able to make a competition for all students in Czech and Slovak. The best I have known. From this weekend I was going home as an event organiser with 5 tournaments to go to. So I just prepared a lot, beacause I was scared if I could make it. I did it. I went and did a presentation in a room of 70 people and it was awesome. Only this trust I was given has made me so much more confident.

## At school I'm good at this, can I try?
While studying Exhibition architecture I had so much fun learning how to use all these graphic programmes. But there just wasn't a place for me to try at school. If you're struggling to find the right chance, just ask for it. I did so in Student Cyber Games and that's how my graphic design journey really begun. I started little but now have made so many competition graphic campaings.

## I like doing this
Since I found that graphic design really fullfilles me, I had to look for a place to learn more. And that's how I got here.

## They all taught me
Soon enough I discovered my life cannot be only about creating even if I wanted it to be. My parents taught me to love nature with their own ambitions. Student Cyber Games has taught me a lot about teamwork and project and so much more from working online to giving a speech. There is just so much in life.

So this is me.
